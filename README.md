Quizzler is an interactive platform to play quizzes and test your knowledge of a particular domain. This application displays the number of questions that the user has got right or wrong in a unique way with the use of icons.

1. Clicking on the icon, the main screen with the first question appears. A bunch of questions has already been added to the system.
